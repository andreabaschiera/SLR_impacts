## CMCC Sea Level Rise Impact Analysis

This repository contains an excerpt of work developed for CMCC (Centro EuroMediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici). The analysis uses input data generated by the biophysical model DIVA, which quantifies sea level rise impacts over time for each country and for each scenario defined by RCP pathway, impact quantile, and adaptation option. A separate README with DIVA output-specific details is also uploaded ([README_DIVA.md](https://github.com/andreabaschiera/SLR_impacts/blob/main/README_DIVA.md)).

The repository is structured to allow transparent replication of three core impact assessments: expected shocks on assets, expected population flooding, and expected land loss. Each assessment follows a common workflow, aimed at repurposing data for use in a CGE economy-wide model and at exploratory data visualisation.

### Overview of Scripts

#### capital.R  
Computes expected shocks to built capital due to sea level rise.  
Steps include:
1. Loading country level DIVA asset exposure inputs
2. Applying preprocessing steps
3. Interpolation of shocks over the years 2017-2100
4. Computation of cumulative impacts (5y and over 2017-2070)
5. Saving and writing CSV and RDS outputs
6. Producing maps and a Shiny dashboard that displays interactively country exposure maps

#### population.R  
Estimates the expected number of people affected by flooding.  
The workflow parallels the one used in the capital script, with population exposure as the dependent variable.

#### land.R  
Evaluates expected land loss. 
Shocks on country land areas are by nature cumulative (land that is lost due to sea level rise does not renew each year), thus requiring slightly different calculations.

#### functions/  
Contains reusable components (with some simple validation checks to ensure consistency), among which:  
- ISO calculations
- Utilities for recalculating cumulative impacts
- Mapping tool used in generating the static maps 

### Outputs

For each of the three impact types, the repository saves:

- **CSV tables** that summarise country level results, disaggregated by output mapping and by scenario-quantile-adaptation option
- **RDS objects** that store structured outputs for reproducible downstream analysis 
- **Maps** of the static cumulative shocks
- **Shiny dashboards** callable from the end of each main script, useful for reviewing spatial and temporal patterns interactively

### Dependencies

All scripts are written in R and rely on widely used packages such as `tidyverse`, `sf`, and `shiny`. Package lists are included at the top of each script.

### Reproducibility

The repository follows a modular structure. Each script can be run independently once the R Project is opened. The functions folder acts as shared library.
